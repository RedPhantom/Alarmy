        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Alarmy</strong> is designed to provide organization-wide reliable alarm capabilities.
            Alarmy services are offered by a central server.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document contains operation instructions for the Alarmy Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application is still in its testing phase.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Capabilities</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
            The interface is divided into several parts, each part contains one or more sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            From top to bottom, the first part - the header - contains the <strong>manager context menu</strong>.<br />
            The second part - from left to right - contains the <strong>Recipient List</strong>, <strong>Alarm Creation Panel</strong>
            and the <strong>Users and Groups Selection Panel</strong>.<br />
            The third part - the footer - contains the <strong>Server Status Indicator</strong> and the <strong>Hover Help Tooltip</strong>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Recipient List</h2>
        <p>
            List of connected users. Checked boxes affect which users will receive the deployed alarm.
            The list can be refreshed by clicking the <strong>Refresh</strong> button below it.
            User selection can be quickly made by the <strong>All</strong> (which selects all users)
            and <strong>None</strong> (which clears the recipient selections).
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            <i>Note</i>: user IDs are composed of the user's computer name and logged in user name.
            Multiple users can be logged in on the same computer (if it's a server, for example)
            and only specified user(s) on that server can be selected as recipients.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            <i>Note</i>: the Recipient List doesn't rapidly refresh. A user may have disconnected from
            the server but still be displayed in the Recipient List and other parts of the application.
            Deploying an alarm to a user that has been disconnected will remove that user from the Recipient
            List. It's recommended to refresh the Recipient List before sending an alarm, if a specific
            user is targeted. A future feature may indicate which users should be connected to the server
            but have since lost connection.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Alarm Creation Panel</h2>
        <p>
            Composed of several fields, the Alarm Creation Panel is the interface in which the system
            administrator creates the alarms which will be deployed to recipient users.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Alarm ID</strong> is a unique string which is used to differ one alarm from another.
            It is automatically generated and cannot be changed. The Alarm ID is used to coordinate between
            the system administrator and the user, as well as provide future alarm verification services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Title</strong> field contains the title of the alarm displayed to the user.
            It can only contain plain text.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Content</strong> field contains the body of the alarm displayed to the user.
            It can contain plain or rich text. As the application doesn't contain a built-in rich text
            format editor, it's recommended that rich text alarms are first created in an application like
            Wordpad or Microsoft Word and then copied and pasted into the Content field.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            <i>Warning</i>: Rich Text alarms allow for sending binary objects, including executable files.
            To protect users from malicious content, users cannot interact with Rich Text alarms.
            Limitations include deactivating hyperlinks and RTF object interaction. For organizations with
            security concerns or on systems connected to the internet, it's recommended to use Text Only
            alarms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Send</strong> button deploys the alarm across the selected recipients in the
            Recipient List.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Users and Groups Selection Panel</h2>
        <p>
            This panel contains two tabs: <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Groups</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Users</strong> tab lists all users that have logged on to the server and the time
            of last contact. Users with an especially old last contact time are marked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Groups</strong> tab lists all groups that support alarm deployment. There needs to be
            at least one connected user of that group for that group to appear in the Groups tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Target Selected</strong> button will apply the selected Users or Groups (depends on
            the selected tab) to the Recipient List.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Server Status Indicator</h2>
        <p>
            This indicator shows the server status: <i>Starting Up</i>, <i>Running</i> or <i>Stopped</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            <i>Note</i>: If the server appears to be "stuck" in the <i>Starting Up</i> phase, check the
            Server Information Console. The server may be waiting for you to type the certificate password.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h1>Server Information Console</h1>
        <p>
            This console opens alongside the primary interface. It is used to report and display system events
            to the system administrator. The severity of events displayed can be configured in the Settings menu
            available under the File menu in the Primary Interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            On sysytems with a certificate configured, the Server Information Console will wait for the sysytem
            administrator to type the certificate password before the startup procedure can continue. Until then,
            the server status will be displayed as Starting Up.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Group Manager</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Group Manager</strong> allows the system administrator to add, edit and remove
            groups to which users can associate themselved.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a group, type a group name in the designated textbox and click <strong>Add</strong> or <code>TAB</code>.<br />
            To remove a group, select a group and click <strong>Remove</strong>.<br />
            To edit a group, click it, type its new name in the designated textbox name and click <strong>Edit</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Save your changes by clicking <strong>Apply</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            <i>Note</i>: editing a group's name doesn't change it's ID. The modified name will only be shown to
            new clients, or clients that refresh their group list.
        </p>
